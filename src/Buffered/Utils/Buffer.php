/**
 * This is a helper class for BufferedStore & TransactionalStore, which buffer
 * real cache requests in memory.
 * The memory-part can easily be handled by MemoryStore. There's just 1 gotcha:
 * when an item is to be deleted (but not yet committed), it needs to be deleted
 * from the MemoryStore too, but we need to be able to make a distinction
 * between "this is deleted" and "this value is not known in this memory cache,
 * fall back to real cache".
 *
 * This is where this class comes in to play: we'll add an additional "expired"
 * method, which allows BufferedStore to just expire the keys that are supposed
 * to be deleted (instead of deleting them) - then we can keep track of when
 * a key is just not known, or known-but-deleted (=expired)
